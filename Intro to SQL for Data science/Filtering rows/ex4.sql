/*WHERE AND
Often, you'll want to select data based on multiple conditions. You can build up your WHERE queries by combining multiple conditions with the AND keyword.

For example,

SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE release_year > 1994
AND release_year < 2000;
gives you the titles of films released between 1994 and 2000.

Note that you need to specify the column name separately for every AND condition, so the following would be invalid:

SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE release_year > 1994 AND < 2000;
You can add as many AND conditions as you need!
